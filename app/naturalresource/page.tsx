            Ghana has been blessed with an abundance of natural resources. There is enough under the ground we are
            walking on daily, to make Ghana one of the richest countries in the world.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm mb-4">
            Unfortunately, due to the past agreements, signed between successive Ghanaian leaders and their foreign
            partners, most of our thirty-four million Ghanaians receive only a very small part of this wealth. Most of it
            goes to foreigners and big elders who signed the agreements.

          <p className="text-sm mb-4">
            The Natural Resource Transformation will change this. A PAG Government will transition the ownership of
            Ghana's natural resources to Ghanaians and will justly reward foreigners for their skills and expertise. Ghanaians
            will become the rightful owners and beneficiaries, at last, of all the wealth that we have in this country.

          <p className="text-sm">
            We will turn our abundant resources in technical, financial and environmental areas to make the release of
            wealth from our land a positive and enriching experience for all the thirty-four million Ghanaians to share in
            equally.
