          Under the Industrial Transformation, Ghana will aim to manufacture all consumer goods locally - from basic necessities like pens, clothing, shoes, TV sets, mobile phones, buses, cars, tractors, building materials, sanitary wares, furniture, aeroplanes and satellites etc.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The older generation will remember that during Nkrumahâ€™s short rule, Ghana was producing many of the items listed above.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This initiative will reduce reliance on imports and stimulate local industry and the creation of millions of jobs for the people of Ghana, fostering economic independence.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We spend over US$ 250 million on used clothing, US$ 400 million (GHS 1.6 billion?) on building materials, US$ 358 million on cars.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The value chain for each of these three items alone, if being produced locally, will release billions of Ghana Cedis into the nation, that will spread prosperity in this country.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          A PAG Government will reverse this trend by initiating a transformation in which we produce most of the goods we need in this country.
